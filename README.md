This project is a full stack tier 3 project showcasing a website that visitors can use for travel info and to log their future plans of travel. Within the Site, visitors 
can get tips for traveling and get recommendations to famous landmarks around the world. It uses API communication with Insomnia, uses render for back-end deployment, and
netlify for front-end deployment.
